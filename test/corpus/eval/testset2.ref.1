Good : More safety for pedestrians !
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lamp on the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach , within sight of the older town hall lights .
Two installations so close to one another : intention or centrifugal ?
This question was answered clearly yesterday by Gutach &apos;s mayor .
&quot; The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path &quot; , explains Eckert yesterday .
Car traffic is safe for cyclists , bus passengers and mountain residents .
The plant , officially opened yesterday , was important for the Crusade of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .
We have the museum , two churches , a spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the ‘ Grub ’ residential area .
&quot; In view of the high traffic and pedestrian traffic volumes , a further traffic light had to be produced for their safety &quot; , Eckert says .
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the State Council in Offenburg .
&quot; According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipal district of Gutach on the B 33 daily , of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic , &quot; Arnold says .
This is why the construction of another light is more than necessary : &quot; Security is easy here &quot; , says Arnold .
In total , four traffic surveys were carried out , and a roundabout was also planned , but were discarded because of the congestion at the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection .
According to Arnold , everything was tested before at the choice of traffic lights : &quot; By means of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks we could check out on the lights .
The traffic light system , which costs approximately 15,000 euros , is the &quot; most modern that exists on the market &quot; , explained Arnold .
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights are visible from the motorists , for example , even in the deep sun .
And it is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
There are three light installations per direction of travel .
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : This is equipped with two radar sensors .
If the pedestrian hits the traffic light , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
If the road is free , there is direct green for the pedestrian , if not it takes about 15 seconds .
Another radar sensor checks whether the initial phase can be stopped for the pedestrian .
&quot; If a group or disabled people go across the road , the green period will be extended , so everyone will come safely over the lane , &quot; said Arnold .
Of course , the driver had to remember as a partner and watch the track .
This was not the case yesterday : the traffic light for pedestrians showed green , the telescope smoked through an upper class vehicle - at glowing red .
Josef Winkler has been writing away the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .
The catastrophes of his Catholic village kindness - voicelessness , inclination to raw violence and stumbling sexuality , the duck and joy - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet .
The prize-winner of the Büchner Prize is primarily known as a prosaist , and the theatre texts are rare in his work .
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance &quot; Weather luminaires on the tip of the tongue &quot; , which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz .
The theater maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot; Der Leibeigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosamines from &quot; Leichnam , reviving his family &quot; ( 2003 ) .
On the largely empty stage - important Requisit : a think-nautical sofa , which is impressively copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is adorned .
But director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
The 70-minute performance surpasses the original with a plethora of rainfalls , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .
The actresses , in particular , come to the attention of somewhat questionable enslavement .
They are tightly attached , dipped with the head under water , stained with their evening albums to the wall .
In cellophane or moody , they are forced into dangerously high sticks by the staging , either monologise them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage .
The text is hardly conveyed in this narrow way .
The best moments are the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song .
It is only towards the end that the above performance comes to rest , and Winklers barely lighten humour .
A black box in the car ?
US street planners are looking for a source of money to fix the decaying Highway system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit in the dashboard of each car .
The devices that record each kilometre and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to overhaul the obsolete system for financing US roads .
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances .
Liberals have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information modestly for calculation .
The Tea Party is horrified .
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection .
But while it is not possible to agree on a course of action in Congress , several states are no longer waiting .
They are currently considering ways to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .
This is a must for our country .
“ It ’ s not something we ’ ll possibly be using , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record Mileage for all California ’ s motorists .
The way we pay these taxes will change .
The technology is there .
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes paid by Americans at the fuel column , is bust .
In America , however , there is no longer as much mowing as before .
Cars consume less petrol .
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even to raise one cent at high cost .
&quot; The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a most-based payment system .
“ This is the most viable alternative in the long term , ” he said .
Bureaucrats call it a most-based user fee .
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals , for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to meet the Federal State &apos;s ambitious , legally binding climate change targets .
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative .
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay after a reduced distance .
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President for Policy at Reason .
People pay directly for what they get .
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move in the direction of mile-based accounting .
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars .
However , the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the process and responded to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city .
Several states and large cities are moving in this direction .
Oregon is currently the most dedicated driver to the country &apos;s largest experiment .
These drivers will soon pay the mileage tax instead of the fuel tax to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City is also considering this .
Illinois uses trucks to test them .
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements .
&quot; Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , &quot; says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Rescue Management at the Ministry of Transport in Nevada .
People did not want it .
When the test started , the ACLU warned of Nevada on their website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-grown surveillance devices . ”
There is no need to build a gigantic , cumbersome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to cover the kilometers passed , but not exactly when and where .
According to Khan , the public would be more reassured .
The search for this technology led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .
The company did not initially intervene to help states tax their car drivers .
Rather , it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers would pay on the basis of the mileage they had travelled .
But the devices she tested are also interesting for street planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .
&quot; People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .
Major mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programmes .
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
In Oregon , the planers experiment with giving drivers a number of choices .
You can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they don ’ t choose any equipment at all and pay a flat rate instead on the basis of the mileage averaged by all inhabitants of the state .
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the equipment with more functions than with lesser .
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tool for taxation , which also pays parking fees , pays insurance for miles only , and allows drivers to leak speed data from other vehicles in real time .
&quot; Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some traffic planners are wondering , however , if all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion exercise .
